**xv6 Memory Management Mastery: On-Demand Loading and Copy-On-Write Brilliance**

**Project Summary:**

In this project, I tackled the intricate realm of process memory management in the xv6 operating system, implementing crucial enhancements through on-demand paging and copy-on-write mechanisms. The tasks were meticulously executed as follows:

**1. Enable On-Demand Binary Loading:**
_Implemented dynamic loading of a program binary's contents, optimizing memory usage by loading only the necessary parts during process creation._

**2. Design a Page Fault Handler:**
_Developed a robust page fault handler intercepting and loading program binary contents on-demand, preventing process termination due to unhandled page faults._

**3. Enable On-Demand Heap Memory:**
_Efficiently managed system memory by implementing on-demand loading of heap memory, enhancing overall memory utilization._

**4. Implement Page Swapping to Disk for Heap Memory:**
_Addressed system memory limitations by implementing intelligent page swapping to disk during page faults, ensuring seamless operation even when free memory is scarce._

**5. Implement Copy-On-Write (CoW) during Fork:**
_Enhanced the fork() system call with the copy-on-write (CoW) optimization. This innovation allowed for the duplication of parent process memory, creating distinct yet identical memory spaces for parent and child processes, thereby conserving memory resources._
